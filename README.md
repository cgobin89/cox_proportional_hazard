This repository contains my script to run a multivariate Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) model with clinical features and protein expression as predictors to assess laryngeal cancer patient survival risk.

**This script is for demonstration purposes only, Access to the real patient dataset is restricted**

## Packages
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- lifelines
- shap

## Features
- OS_Months: Survival duration (months); float
- OS_Status: Death event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored); integer
- Age: Age at baseline; float
- Sex: 0 = female, 1 = male; integer
- Race: 0 = White, 1 = Black; integer
- Treatment: 0 = Tx naive, 1 = Tx received; integer
- ABCC1: 0 = low H scores < 100, 1 = high H scores â‰¥ 100; integer
- Grade: 0 = well differentiated, 1 = moderately/poorly differentiated; integer
- MRN: Patient ID used for labeling in risk score table; string

## Outputs
- Cox PH summary: hazard ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values for each feature assessed individually while holding the other features constant
- Patient-level risk score and median risk score calculation, with subsequent stratification into low vs high-risk groups based on median
- C-index: quantifies predictive ability of the Cox PH model in discriminating between low and high-risk patients
- -log2(p) of log-likelihood ratio test values > 4.32 indicate overall model significance, informing how well the set of predictors fits the observed survival times
- Nomograms and SHAP plots: visually demonstrate the direction of feature values in relation to their contribution to predicted risk
- Kaplan-Meier plots: visually demonstrate survival by predicted risk groups and individual features, including log-rank p-values to indicate significance between curves
- Scatter plots: visualize individual patients by risk scores and feature values
- Risk score table: outputs patient IDs, feature values, risk scores, and risk category
